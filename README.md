# Birds of Aotearoa (Front-end)

## Introduction
This was an assignment for COSC302 - Web, Databases, and Networks.
We were tasked with building the front-end for a web application to browse the NZBirds dataset.
I decided to make the theme of my website a retro windows aesthetic.


#### NZBirds dataset
The data set contains 68 species of NZ birds and has been compiled by University of Otago in collaboration with The National Museum of NZ (Te Papa), the Department of Conservation (DOC) and the Ornithological Society of NZ (Birds NZ). There are also 68 images that have been made available by individual bird photographers of New Zealand.

This data was kindly provided to us under good faith under the condition it is only used for research and educational purposes here at the University of Otago.

## Features
- Search via string (both MƒÅori and English)
- Sort the birds with various different categories
- Each birds conservation status is displayed on their card
- A like feature so that you can favourite or unfavourite birds by clicking on the ü§ç icon on the top right of their photos, then by clicking on the ü§ç button at the top left of the webpage you are able to view your favourite birds.
